Here are some basic shell scripts I use to save time  

**Disclosure and warnings**  
- These were written for personal use, but I decided to keep them public. If they don't support exactly what you are looking for/arguments for you to make changes to how something installs etc., my apologies in advance.  Do feel free to raise an issue though, if it is an interesting problem I might take it up.  
- More importantly, if you decide to use these scripts, you do it **at your own risk**. Although I use these scrips often without issues, **nothing in this repository comes with any guarantee whatsoever**.
